    "### Section 1: Statistical test\n",
    "#### 1.1 Statistical test\n",
    "Mann-Whitney-U test is used to analyze the subway data. \n",
    "\n",
    "One tailed P-value is used. Python implementation of Mann-Whitney-u-test checks for one -tailed pvalues. To obtain the two tailed p- values we can multiply it by 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Null-Hypothesis**: There is no significant difference in subway ridership between rainy and non-rainy days. \n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value obtained is 0.0249 which is less than the alpha -critical value of 0.05. \n",
    "#### 1.2 Reasoning\n",
    "Mann-Whitney-U test is application in this case as we are not assuming any difference in the values of \n",
    "two samples. We test that whether a particular population tends to differ from other. \n",
    "#### 1.3 Results:\n",
    "Data  Mean Value  p-Value\n",
    "With Rain  1105.447  0.0249\n",
    "Without Rain  1090.279  0.0249\n",
    "#### 1.4 Interpretation\n",
    "From the above table we can see that the mean values are different and the corresponding p- critical \n",
    "value is less than the alpha critical limit of 0.05. This means that it is very unlikely that the samples are \n",
    "from the same population as the probability is very low. \n",
    "Since the samples are from the different population. Then we can reject the null hypothesis that the \n",
    "ridership during the rainy and non-rainy days does not change. \n",
    "We can confidently say that rain has an effect on ridership."

    "I decided to use the above mentioned features because of the following reasons\n",
    "\n",
    "a.  **Rain** : I thought that when it is rainy outside people tend to find the safest and easiest transport \n",
    "to travel. Also there may be traffic jams / other instances where people may get late to reach \n",
    "their destination. So I thought that rain may increase the ridership. \n",
    "\n",
    "b.  **Hour** : Subway Entries are dependent on hours of the day. More people leave home for work \n",
    "and since most of the jobs start between 8 to 10 am. Hence more people tend to travel at that \n",
    "period of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "c. **MinTempi** : This feature I chose because it chose a positive ( but low ) correlation with the \n",
    "hourly entries and when I used it in the regression my R^2 value increased from 4.783 to 4.795. \n",
    "This increases the R^2 value but not much. Hence this feature can be dropped to keep the \n",
    "model simple. \n",

    "say that more people ride in the subway while it’s raining outside. \n",
    "b. Nothing can be conclusively said by the parameters of the linear regression model but the coefficient \n",
    "value of the rain parameter in the model is positive and significant with respect to other parameters \n",

    "be dependent upon other factors. \n",
    "Also the data of hourly entries is I think clubbed into the interval of 4 hours. This generalization may also \n",
    "give false information about ridership at particular hour. \n",
